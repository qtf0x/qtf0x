## Hi, I'm Vincent

I'm a (computer-|math-|philosophy-|music-)nerd and advocate of free ([as in
freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)) software. I like to
learn systems deeply, build with purpose, and get as far down into the weeds as
I can.

My main interests are in 3D computer graphics, game (engine) development,
compilers, and operating systems. Additional passions of mine include improving
STEM education and how we think about software design. I also love learning
about most other areas of theoretical and applied computer science/mathematics.

Nothing I've ever written or ever will write was generated, in part or in
whole, by AI tools. Do not feed any of my work to any AI, or else I'll get,
like, really upset :<

**Note:** Mind the gap in contributions during 2025; I was trying out other version control systems and hosting services. I came to the conclusion that none of them are good. Until I get a usable fully-self-hosted solution set up, I'd direct you to the Forgejo instance at [git.gay/qtf0x](https://git.gay/qtf0x/) as my preferred host, but everything will get mirrored here for redundancy.
