Mind the gap in contributions during 2025; I was trying out other version control systems and hosting services. I came to the conclusion that none of them are good. Until I get a usable fully-self-hosted solution set up, I'd direct you to the Forgejo instance at [git.gay/qtf0x](https://git.gay/qtf0x/) as my preferred host, but everything will get mirrored here for redundancy.
