support open-source software (and hardware) projects by USING THEM

support your local catgirl/arch user by PETTING THEM

support the woke agenda by finding the nearest transphobe and BULLYING THEM

did you know that Microsoft scans all your code and files in GitHub, including in private repos, to feed to large language models?

anyway, in unrelated news, i'm currently in the process of moving everything off of GitHub, and you should be too! use GitLab, self-host a git server, doesn't matter, just don't give you data to Microsoft :3
